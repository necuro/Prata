WE PETITION THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO:
Impose personal sanctions on President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych and Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine members
On the 21 November 2013 the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has adopted resolution to suspend the preparation process to conclude Association Agreement with European Union.

We cannot accept the fact that President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych and his government deny the right of the people of Ukraine to become closer to the Western civilization.

We demand to impose personal sanctions on Mr Yanukovych and Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine members unless Mr Yanukovych signs the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement during Eastern Partnership summit in Vilnius, Lithuania on 29 November 2013:

The sanctions should include but not be limited to:

- Ban to enter the U.S. and EU for Mr Yanukovych and Ukraine government members families.

- Freeze bank accounts of companies affiliated with them
